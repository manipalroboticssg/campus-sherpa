# Campus Sherpa

## Introduction

Robots have a lot of potential in things like the service industry, especially for guiding people around massive campuses such as educational institutions. There's a lot of service robots that are used in the hotel industry in this manner, but none that do this for the outdoors.

Now when these indoor service robots are coupled with GPS and LIDAR sensors theyll have both increased range and significantly better spatial awareness by a huge margin which opens whole new and diverse applications.
 
 When there's good spatial awareness , robots can be used as guides in various sectors ranging from militiary to amusement parks and other areas with massive perimeter around them.
 
 Apart from being guides when these robots are altered to have a good storage and carrying capacity these robots can also be used to transport objects from point A to point B inside a well defined perimeter.
 
 Based on the topology of various regions inside this specified perimeter intelligent algorithms can be made which can help the robot with proper navigation and path routing. With a proper routing the robot can achieve a well defined motion throughout its journey.

As mentioned before this can be possible with the coupling of GPS coordinates data and LIDAR data. 

"Campus Sherpa" is a UGV capable of autonomous travel around this well defined perimeter and also can follow a live travelling object(usually a human) by assuming the object as a beacon.

The UGV can identify places when the geo positional coordinates from the GPS receiver are labelled.
