## Introduction

Robotics is a rapidly evolving field that has been revolutionizing various industries, ranging from manufacturing to healthcare. Over the past few years, robotics has made tremendous advancements, and robots have become more intelligent, sophisticated, and versatile. As a result, the applications of robotics have also expanded significantly. With an increase in the pace of innovation in recent years, many sectors like manufacturing,space,healthcare etc are already using robots to ensure significantly higher quality, precision and efficiency. Robots are now capable of much more than simple commands, as they're able to function automously for extended periods of time, interact with humans in in public settings, assist humans when working on tasks together, and many more such applications where the interaction of humans and robots takes centre stage.

For example, service robots are becoming increasingly popular in the hospitality industry as a means to provide efficient and personalized service to guests. These robots can perform a variety of tasks, such as delivering room service, providing information about the hotel and local area, and also guiding guests to locations and rooms. Service robots can help hotels reduce labor costs, increase operational efficiency, and improve the overall guest experience. This functionality also extends to healthcare where nurse robots can guide patients around the hospital and direct them to their intended consultation rooms, or push hospital beds from palec to place.

When speaking about operating robots with humans in harsh environments, disaster management is also a prime use case for such behaviour, where robots can lead rescue teams in searching an area, clearing the path as they make their way through debris and wreckage. In the defence sector, robot mules can carry important equipment and ammunition while following soldiers on the battlefield, thus alleviating the brunt of the weight on the soldier's shoulders. Robots that can follow astronauts and assist them with tasks during space exploration are becoming an increasingly important part of space missions. These robots are designed to be able to navigate in microgravity environments, operate in extreme temperatures, and withstand the harsh radiation and other hazards of space. Including space rovers with this functionality will also allow them to document places from images and follow humans as they are guided by the robot's navigation system.
