## Introduction

Robotics is a rapidly evolving field that has been revolutionizing various industries, ranging from manufacturing to healthcare. Over the past few years, robotics has made tremendous advancements, and robots have become more intelligent, sophisticated, and versatile. As a result, the applications of robotics have also expanded significantly. With increase in the pace of innovation in the field of AI and automation in the recent years the robotics field gained very broad and diverse applications.

Industrial Revolution 5.0 is a term coined by the World Economic Forum (WEF) to describe the current phase of industrial revolution that is being driven by advancements in digital technology, particularly in the fields of automation, robotics, and artificial intelligence. It is a period of rapid technological change that is being driven by advancements in digital technology, particularly in the fields of automation, robotics, and artificial intelligence. Robotics is playing a central role in this revolution, as the technology is being used to automate a wide range of tasks in various industries. As robotics technology continues to advance, it is likely that we will see even more innovative applications of robotics in the future. Many sectors like manufacturing,space,healthcare etc are already using robots to provide service with significantly higher quality,precision and efficiency.And sectors like agriculture,defense and deep sea exploration are already starting to use various kinds of robotic technologies and is expected keep on progressing in the coming decades.

### Manufacturing 

The use of robots in manufacturing has been on the rise since the 1960s, when they were first introduced as part of what technologists call Industry 3.0 (defined by programmable logic and advanced manufacturing). Robots grew up in the car industry, where they were used primarily to weld car bodies together. As technologies matured, companies began using robots in other areas, such as logistics and the medical and food industries. Starting in 2006, more robots were used outside the automotive industry than inside it.
The main driver behind the rise of industrial robots was a desire to reduce or eliminate the "three Ds"-dull, dangerous, and dirty jobs. But other important drivers included the need for consistency of quality and consistency of flow in manufacturing.

### Space exploration

Robots are able to withstand harsh conditions and high levels of radiation, yet despite the cost of producing them, it is more cost-effective to send an autonomous machine to space instead of a human. An unmanned space probe doesn’t need to cater to a human-life with regulated temperatures and breathability. They possess the ability to travel close to the sun – where heat and radiation levels would kill a human-being – and withstand long-term voyages as far as interstellar space, with temperatures as low as 2.7 Kelvin (-270.45 Celsius, -454.81 Fahrenheit). Voyager 1, which launched in 1977, left the heliosphere in 2018 and has continued to send never-before-seen valuable data back to Earth. With this in mind, it makes sense to explore the importance of space innovation.We can send **robots** to explore space without having to worry so much about their safety. Of course, we want these carefully built robots to last. We need them to stick around long enough to investigate and send us information about their destinations. But even if a robotic mission fails, the humans involved with the mission stay safe.Robots don’t need to eat or sleep or go to the bathroom. They can survive in space for many years and can be left out there—no need for a return trip!

### Healthcare

The healthcare field is constantly looking for ways to support and evolve the care that is being delivered to patients. In recent years, these efforts have included the incorporation of various technologies into healthcare delivery. While one such technological advancement -robotics- has yet to become a standard fixture of any healthcare organization, it is reasonable to believe that this will not remain the case for much longer. As such, it is important to understand how robots are currently being used throughout the healthcare field, as well as how they are being received by patients and healthcare professionals. Identifying any potential issues that could impact the current or future use of robots in the healthcare field is vital for the continued growth of these technologies.Over the years, the associated technologies have continued to improve and provide benefits, such as increased dexterity and decreased fatigue, to surgeons. Other common healthcare-related uses for robots involve the delivery of medical supplies or medications to nursing units, the cleaning and sanitation of the healthcare environment, and the provision of companionship to patients.

### Deep sea exploration

**Remotely operated vehicles**
 (ROVs) are robots tethered to the ship. Scientists on the ship manipulate an ROV through a long cable that connects the robot to the ship. ROVs can reach great depths and stay there for extended periods. **Autonomous underwater vehicles**
 (AUVs) are robots pre-programmed to collect data from particular parts of the deep ocean. While they’re off collecting data, scientists conduct other research on board the ship. **Hybrid vehicles**
 combine the best features of ROVs and AUVs. On May 31, 2009, one hybrid vehicle—the *Nereus*
—reached the deepest part of the ocean, the Mariana Trench. It dived 10,902 meters (6.8 miles) below the surface. We can only imagine what new underwater technologies will accomplish 50 years from now.

### Disaster management

Technologies like AI, Robotics, Networking and sensors are transforming the future of disaster relief and are able to prevent them in the first place and get help to victims during that first golden hour where in immediate relief can save lives. As hardware advancements converge with exploding AI capabilities, disaster relief robots are graduating from assistance roles to fully autonomous responders at a breakneck pace. In the case of wildfires and conflict zones, autonomous drone technology is fundamentally revolutionizing the way we identify survivors in need and automate relief supply. Not only are drones enabling high-resolution imagery for real-time mapping and damage assessment, but preliminary research shows that UAVs far outpace ground-based rescue teams in locating isolated survivors. But drone technology is even beginning to transcend the limited scale of medical supplies and food. As hardware continues to advance, autonomous drone technology coupled with real-time mapping algorithms pose no end of abundant opportunities for aid supply, disaster monitoring, and richly layered intel previously unimaginable for humanitarian relief. While AI-driven intel platforms crowdsource firsthand experiential data from those on the ground, mobile connectivity and drone-supplied networks are granting newfound narrative power to those most in need. And as a wave of new hardware advancements gives rise to robotic responders, swarm technology, and aerial drones, we are fast approaching an age of instantaneous and efficiently-distributed responses in the midst of conflict and natural catastrophes alike.

### Military and defense

Defense robots are professional service robots that are deployed by the military in combat scenarios. They’re often intended to enhance a soldier’s existing capabilities while keeping them out of harm’s way as much as possible. Defense robots contribute to military superiority by giving troops an advantage at the ground level. Militaries as a whole gain a tactical advantage through the use of defense robots. Defense robots come in many shapes and sizes, but most serve the same basic functions of protecting and enabling soldiers in combat.Field robots, another form of professional service robot, are also becoming common in defense applications. These defense robots perform a variety of functions, including:

- carrying heavy equipment;
- operating in dangerous situations to keep soldiers at a safer distance;
- and rescuing wounded soldiers in combat zones.

Some field robots in defense applications are beginning to be equipped with weapons for offensive capabilities. Defense robots are an increasingly common part of military campaigns, helping to keep soldiers safe and providing a tactical advantage in nearly any combat scenario.

### Agriculture

Agriculture is quickly becoming an exciting high-tech industry, drawing new professionals, new companies and new investors. The technology is developing rapidly, not only advancing the production capabilities of farmers but also advancing robotics and automation technology as we know it. At the heart of this phenomenon is the need for significantly increased production yields. The UN estimates the world population will rise from 7.3 billion today to 9.7 billion in 2050. The world will need a lot more food, and farmers will face serious pressure to keep up with demand. Agricultural robots are increasing production yields for farmers in various ways. From drones to autonomous tractors to robotic arms, the technology is being deployed in creative and innovative applications. Agricultural robots automate slow, repetitive and dull tasks for farmers, allowing them to focus more on improving overall production yields. Some of the most common robots in agriculture are used for Harvesting and picking, Weed control, Autonomous mowing, pruning, seeding, spraying and thinning, Phenotyping, Sorting and packing and other Utility platforms.

### Construction

Robots may never completely eliminate the need for human workers in the construction industry, but there are many applications robots could be used to make work on the construction site faster, safer, easier, and less labor-intensive. The most likely scenario is that robots will be used alongside human workers to augment their work, keep them safer and boost productivity. The current capabilities of existing robots, combined with a growing labor shortage will probably lead to robots handling some of the more menial repetitive tasks, leaving the human worker to focus on other aspects of their job. ****Brick Laying, Construction Layouts, Demolition, Self-Driving Trucks & Heavy Equipment and jobsite monitoring can be fullfilled by robotic integration.
