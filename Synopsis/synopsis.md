# Campus Sherpa

## Introduction
Robots have a lot of potential in things like the service industry, especially for guiding people around massive campuses such as educational institutions. There's a lot of service robots that are used in the hotel industry in this manner, but none that do this for the outdoors.

The folllowing examples can be a good collection of UGV applications in various fields :

1. Security and surveillance: UGVs can be used for patrolling and monitoring premises for security purposes. They can be equipped with cameras and other sensors to detect intruders and potential threats. UGVs can also be used for inspecting critical infrastructure like pipelines, power grids, and bridges.

2. Healthcare: UGVs can be used in the healthcare industry for tasks like delivering medical supplies, transporting patients, and assisting with surgeries. UGVs can also be used for disinfecting hospital rooms and other areas.

3. Can be retrofitted as a weapon platform in defense  applications and assist soldiers in battles and rescue operations.


4. UGVs when equipped with GPRs(ground penetrating radars ) and magnetic sensors can be used in mine detection. These technologies when coupled with intelligent     algorithms can function more efficiently 


5. Agriculture: UGVs can be used in agriculture for tasks such as planting, harvesting, and spraying crops. They can also be used for soil analysis, mapping, and monitoring crop health.

6. These robots can be used in places and environments where the human presence may not be a viable option

Overall when these unmanned vehicles are coupled with intelligent sensors and technologies the applications are very diverse and since everyday new technologies are coming into the world the potential application areas are continuously expanding.
